I also see that it can be adjusted by turning the \u201cSM1\u201d 1.035-40 threads. Does the load rating only apply for static loads or can you adjust the height while it is bearing a load? Do you have a maximum load rating for when the height is being adjusted?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"The 500 lbs load capacity is for static loads when the height is locked in place by its knurled locking ring. The BLP01 must be able to rotate to adjust its height. If one end is secure any components attached to the rotating end will also rotate as the height is adjusted. Without the locking ring, the only thing holding the height of the BLP01 in place is the friction of the SM1 threads. It would mainly be up to the user to bear the load (or simply remove it) when adjusting the height, though there is also 0.23\" OD thru hole in the smooth, upper adjustable height portion of the post to apply extra torque when increasing\/decreasing the variable height of the post.. Unfortunately we do not spec the amount of weight the BLP01 can hold without the locking ring tightened in place."}]}

I want to use it to seal small\ncracks that should be vacuum-tight at high temperatures afterwards. What\nis the highest recommended operating temperature? And is there any\ninformation available what happens to Torr Seal at higher temperatures?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"For the TS10 we have only the Vendor information available.  We have no experience for higher temperatures !\nTemperature - 45\u00b0 C to 120\u00b0 C; cracks at LN2 temperatures\n \nTorr Seal epoxy resin quickly seals leaks on any type of vacuum system or component,  Torr Seal is solvent free and can be used at pressures of  of 10^-9 Torr (mbar) and below, at temperatures from -45\u00b0 C to 120\u00b0 C (bakeable temperature).\n \nAdditionally, Torr Seal permits leak checking immediately after curing and bonds with many materials including metal, ceramic, and glass."}]}

Question: We are looking to buy some laser safety glasses wot work with lasers from 2\u00b5m to 5\u00b5m, from looking at the Thorlabs website it seems the LG11 model would be best, though the optical density graph cuts off at 3\u00b5m. Could you confirm this would be the best set of glasses for working with 2\u00b5m-5\u00b5m lasers or provided some suggestions as to a better model."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Thanks for your message. Determining whether a certain product is suitable for a specific laser setup requires a detailed on-site evaluation of the conditions (laser type, beam path etc.). This is part of the responsibility of the laser safety officer of your organisation. They have to evaluate the local situation and define the needed laser safety class (called \"L\"-rating according to the European Standard EN207) for the goggles. Based on that information the product can be chosen. We - as a reseller of these laser glasses - cannot take over any responsibility for the correct selection based on descriptive information of a setup or laser. Since we do not offer on-site evaluations, we cannot state that a certain item is suitable and sufficient for a certain application, neither can we recommend an item from our side.\n \nOnce your safety officer has defined the needed L-rating for the goggles we will be happy checking if we can offer a suitable product. Copies of the EN207 certificates are available as well (pdf format).\n \nOnce you have selected the correct laser glasses then I will be happy to forward you a quotation. Please contact us if you have any further queries.\n\nLaser Safety Glasses: https:\/\/www.thorlabs.com\/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=762"}]}

It could become critical from approx. > 3 or 4 kg.\nEach RCA1 used 4 times M4 set screws for mounting on ERxx Rods.

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Case Title: Kinematic Base Rods\/Rollers. Question: For some time I have been wondering about the rods\/rollers from the bottom part of the kinematic base, which keep the balls and the top part in their position. See the part highlighted in the attached image. How are these rollers put into position (for example in the KB1X1 Kinematic Base). Are these rollers fixed or movable, and can they be removed? If they are fixed, could you provide some details on how they are mounted?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Thank you for your enquiry.\n \nI have taken a look at the assembly plans of the KB1X1, and the dowels (or rollers as you said) are arbor pressed into their respective H-patterns on the bottom plate of the KB1X1. The dowels are therefore immovable and are fixed.\n \nThe ball bearings are super glued into their places, while the strong magnets are epoxied using a combination of Loctite 7649 and Loctite 680.\n \nI hope I have answered your question. Please do not hesitate to ask me again, should you have any further."}]}
